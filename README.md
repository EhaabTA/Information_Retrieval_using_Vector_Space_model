## **Information_Retrieval_using_Vector_Space_model**

This project is based on the implementation of Vecter space model and cosine similarity algorithm of Machine Learning to compare the input text and the text in text file from the given dataset "Research_Papers" to retrieve the text files and their cosine similarity score given the input text.
